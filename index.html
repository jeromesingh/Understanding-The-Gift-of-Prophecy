  <h3>Evidences</h3>
  <br>
  
  <p><span class="btext">Romans 5:1-5 KJV</span>  Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:  (2)  By
  whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.  (3)  And
  not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;  (4)  And patience,
  experience; and experience, hope:  (5)  And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our
  hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">2 Peter 1:12-21 KJV</span>  Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know
them, and be established in the present truth.  (13)  Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir
you up by putting you in remembrance;  (14)  Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord
Jesus Christ hath shewed me.  (15)  Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things
always in remembrance.  (16)  For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power
and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.  (17)  For he received from God the Father
honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased.  (18)  And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.  (19)  We
have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark
place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:  (20)  Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the
scripture is of any private interpretation.  (21)  For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy
men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">1 Corinthians 14:32 KJV</span>  And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">1 Corinthians 4:9 KJV</span>  For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we
are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Revelation 12:17 KJV</span>  And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which
keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Revelation 19:10 KJV</span>  And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy
fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the
spirit of prophecy.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Revelation 19:10 KJV</span>  And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy
fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the
spirit of prophecy.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Exodus 15:20-21 KJV</span>  And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went
out after her with timbrels and with dances.  (21)  And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed
gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Numbers 12:5-8 KJV</span>  And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and
called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.  (6)  And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among
you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.  (7)  My servant Moses
is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.  (8)  With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in
dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my
servant Moses?
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Isaiah 63:10-14 KJV</span>  But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he
fought against them.  (11)  Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought
them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?  (12)  That led
them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting
name?  (13)  That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?  (14)  As a
beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make
thyself a glorious name.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Hosea 12:10 KJV</span>  I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the
ministry of the prophets.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Hosea 12:13 KJV</span>  And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">2 Chronicles 20:20 KJV</span>  And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they
went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God,
so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Proverbs 29:18 KJV</span>  Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Lamentations 2:9 KJV</span>  Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her
princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">2 Peter 2:1 KJV</span>  But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you,
who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift
destruction.
</p>

<p class="gtext"><span class="btext">Matthew 7:15 KJV</span>  Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening
wolves.
</p>

<p class="gtext"><span class="btext">Matthew 7:20 KJV</span>  Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
</p>

<h5>Beware of False Prophets</h5>

<p><span class="btext">Peter 2:12-18 KJV</span>  But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that
they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;  (13)  And shall receive the reward of
unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting
themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;  (14)  Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot
cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:  (15) 
Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the
wages of unrighteousness;  (16)  But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the
madness of the prophet.  (17)  These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist
of darkness is reserved for ever.  (18)  For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the
lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">1 Kings 22:5 KJV</span>  And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">1 Kings 22:9 KJV</span>  Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">1 Kings 22:13 KJV</span>  And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the
prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and
speak that which is good.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">1 John 4:1-3 KJV</span>  Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false
prophets are gone out into the world.  (2)  Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus
Christ is come in the flesh is of God:  (3)  And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is
it in the world.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Jeremiah 25:12 KJV</span>  And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of
Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual
desolations.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Jeremiah 28:1-6 KJV</span>  And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the
fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in
the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,  (2)  Thus speaketh the LORD of
hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.  (3)  Within two full years will I
bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this
place, and carried them to Babylon:  (4)  And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of
Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of
Babylon.  (5)  Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the
presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,  (6)  Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do
so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD'S house, and all that
is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Jeremiah 28:10 KJV</span>  Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.
</p>

<p><span class="btext">Jeremiah 28:12-14 KJV</span>  Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had
broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,  (13)  Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the
LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.  (14)  For thus saith the LORD of
hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
